## How to read this project?

* We recommend to open `report.pdf` along with the notebooks listed below. The report details the methods and provides the results along with insights we gained. The notebooks contain some visualizations that may not be on the report. Please look at the `code` folder for any details about the code.

## File Directory Description

* `/code/`: 
	
	* `Data processing and visulization.py`: this file contains code for data loading, cleaning and visualization.

	* `Original.py`: this file contains code for applying Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM on the original data set. 

	* `PCA.py`: this file contains code for applying Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM on the PCA data set.
    
	* `High correlation filter.py`: this file contains code for applying Logistic regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM on the 
	correlation filter data set.
